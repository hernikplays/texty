# texty 
An extremely simple text-adventure game ~~engine(?)~~ player 

## What is this?
I was bored

## How do I make a game
Check out the `example.yml` file, all games are in the `YAML` format.

## How do I use this
Download/clone the repo and run the `__main__.py` file. You need to have a valid game in a `games` folder.

## TODO
